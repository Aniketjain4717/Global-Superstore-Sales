# Global-Superstore-Sales

Designed and executed complex SQL queries on a relational dataset (~10K+ records) to extract key business insights related to sales, profit, and regional performance.

Cleaned and transformed data by converting text-based dates into SQL date format, normalizing categorical fields (e.g., region), and handling missing or incorrect data types.

Conducted profitability analysis across customer segments, identifying top 5 most profitable customers and regional sales disparities using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions.

Created window functions (e.g., RANK() OVER) to rank customers based on total sales, supporting customer segmentation strategies.

Developed case-based logic to flag high-profit transactions (e.g., CASE WHEN Profit > 1000 THEN 'Yes') and created a new derived column.

Performed time-series sales analysis by year and month using DATE_FORMAT() and filtering date ranges to evaluate 2023 trends.

Delivered actionable insights through multi-level aggregation of categories/sub-categories to support marketing and supply chain decisions.
